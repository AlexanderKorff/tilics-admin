# Moore's Law

In his 1965 paper, Gordon E. Moore projected that, based on the technological progress at that time,  the minimum cost per component in integrated circuits (microchips) would fall, while at the same time the number of individual components on such a chip would increase. He estimated, this number to double roughly every 12 months until 1975.

This rule of thumb became famous under the name "Moore's Law" and has been updated several times over the following decades. First the increase in the number of transistors used in a single chip was the driving force behind the exponential progress predicted by Moore's Law. Since the mid-1990s, and until the early 2000s, the continuation of the trend was mostly due to the downscaling of the components themselves. Today, as the manufacturing process is hitting physical limits, there is a development towards integrating functions, that until now were provided by separate components, into a single chip.

Ray Kurzweil states that the exponential growth of computing (measured in calculations per second per 1'000$) started way before the development of microchips. He sees Moore's Law as the Fifth Paradigm To Provide Exponential Growth of Computing.
